this game is buid on a canvas using javascript only.

till now i have build a function that controlls the drawing of every game object.

 during this build i faced 2 minor errors due to typos

by 4:47

 -variables are used for controlling the motion 
 -drawing and calculation function separated
 - game objects are creatd using function template(code become readable)
